## UNIVERSAL PROMPT (Use This First, Always)

```
You are designing for DeadSoxy, a product-first premium essentials brand built on engineered comfort and precision construction. Follow these constraints exactly:

BRAND: Confident, restrained, intelligent, engineered. Never hype-driven, never loud, never gimmicky. Prioritize clarity, craftsmanship, and subtle performance advantages (like TrueStay™ grip) — not trendiness or decoration.

COLORS:
- Charcoal #2D2D2D — primary (text, UI, headlines) — minimum 50% of layout
- Magenta #D500F8 — accent (CTAs, highlights) — maximum 20% of layout
- Gold #FFBB3B — rare accent (premium moments only) — maximum 8% of layout
- White #FFFFFF — primary background

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Gotham Book (or Inter/Helvetica Neue as fallback) for all UI, headlines, body
- Mrs Eaves Roman (or Georgia as fallback) for editorial moments only — max 1 per layout
- Headlines: uppercase, bold, tight
- Body: sentence case, 16px, 1.6 line height
- Labels: uppercase, 12px, wide letter spacing

LAYOUT:
- 8pt spacing grid: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96px only
- 12px corner radius
- Generous whitespace — when in doubt, add more space
- One dominant element per section
- Perfect alignment on all axes

NEVER:
- Gradients, drop shadows on text, lens flares
- Script fonts, decorative fonts, novelty fonts
- Busy patterns, textured backgrounds
- Neon colors, over-saturated palettes
- Stock-photo compositions, clip art
- Exclamation marks in headlines
- Hype words: "ultimate", "next level", "game changer", "revolutionary"

## PRODUCT INFOGRAPHIC PROMPT

```

Labels in uppercase 12px sans-serif (Gotham/Inter style), wide letter spacing. One headline in uppercase bold sans-serif. Magenta (#D500F8) accent used for one key highlight only — maximum 20% of layout. No decorative elements. No gradients. No clutter. Engineered precision, Apple product page aesthetic.
```

---

## WEBSITE HERO SECTION PROMPT

```
DeadSoxy website hero section. White background, maximum whitespace. H1: large, uppercase, bold Gotham/Inter style. One supporting sentence underneath in regular weight. One CTA button: charcoal background, white uppercase text, pill-shaped. Magenta (#D500F8) only if a second CTA is needed. No extra shapes, no background images, no decorative elements. Layout feels like a premium essentials brand — clean, confident, engineered.
```

---

## WEBSITE LANDING PAGE PROMPT

```
DeadSoxy landing page layout. White background throughout. Sections separated by generous whitespace (64px minimum). Each section has one clear purpose: hero, features, product detail, social proof, CTA. Typography: uppercase bold headings (Gotham/Inter), sentence case body text, uppercase micro-labels for eyebrows. Color usage: charcoal dominant, magenta accent on primary CTAs only (max 20%), gold reserved for premium callouts (max 8%). 8pt grid spacing. 12px corner radius on cards. No clutter, no gradients, no decorative illustration. Every element earns its place.
```

## B2B / INVESTOR DECK PROMPT

```
DeadSoxy B2B presentation slide. White background, charcoal text. One dominant headline per slide in uppercase bold sans-serif. Maximum 3 bullet points per slide. Body text 16px regular weight. Data visualizations: clean, minimal, charcoal with magenta accent for key data point only. No decorative elements, no stock photos, no clip art. 8pt grid alignment. Bottom-right corner: DeadSoxy logo small. Feels engineered, precise, high-trust. Like a premium essentials brand presenting to sophisticated buyers.
```

## SOCIAL MEDIA POST PROMPT

```
DeadSoxy social media graphic. White or charcoal background only. One product or one headline — never both competing. If product: centered, soft shadow, pure background. If text: large uppercase headline, one supporting line max. Magenta accent used for one element only. No busy layouts, no collage style, no heavy filters. Square (1:1) or vertical (4:5) format. Feels premium, restrained, confident. Not loud. Not trendy. Engineered.
```

---

## PACKAGING CONCEPT PROMPT

```
DeadSoxy premium packaging layout. Minimal typography, high-end restraint. Mrs Eaves Roman (or Georgia) for one editorial accent line only. Everything else in Gotham (or Helvetica Neue) style. Charcoal ink primary. Magenta accent used on one small detail only. No patterns, no texture, no busy design. Matte finish feel. Luxury and precise. Looks like it belongs next to Aesop or Apple packaging.
```

## EMAIL DESIGN PROMPT

```
DeadSoxy email layout. White background, single column, max 600px width. Charcoal text, Gotham/Inter style typography. One hero image or headline at top. Body text 16px, sentence case, short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max). One primary CTA button: charcoal or magenta, pill-shaped, uppercase text. No sidebar, no multi-column chaos. No decorative borders or background patterns. Clean, scannable, premium. Unsubscribe link at bottom in small charcoal text.
```

## COPY / WRITING PROMPT

```
Write copy for DeadSoxy, a premium everyday sock brand. Voice rules:
- Short sentences. Direct. Product-first.
- Confident but not arrogant. Precise but not cold.
- Average sentence length: under 18 words.
- Tone: calm confidence with Southern grit.
- Use em dashes over hyphens for breaks.
- Periods in headlines are OK. Exclamation marks are not.
- Never use: "ultimate", "next level", "game changer", "revolutionary", "not your average", "say goodbye to"
- Never use hype language or startup jargon.
- The product speaks for itself. Describe what it is and why the details matter.

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

1. **Start every AI session** by pasting the Universal Prompt block
2. **Then paste the specific task prompt** (product shot, landing page, deck, etc.)
3. **Then give your specific instructions** ("show the merino wool crew sock", "make a 5-slide deck", etc.)

This layered approach gives AI:
- Brand constraints (universal)
- Task-specific rules (template)
- Your specific creative direction (your instructions)

That eliminates drift and keeps every output on-brand.
